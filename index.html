      <h1>Welcome to the <em>Montreal Flag Football League!</em></h1>
      <p>The MFFL, is a new flag football league based in Montreal, Quebec, that has been running strong since the
        summer of 2019. The league was created by <b>Matthew Reda</b> and <b>Seena Sabet-Kassouf</b> in order to allow
        young athletes a chance to stay in shape, compete and most importantly, have fun.</p>
      <p>Every year our season begins the first week of July and runs a 10 week regular season, followed by playoffs.
        All games are contested outdoors at both our beautiful locations with the possibility of moving indoors if we
        run into terrible weather conditions.</p>
      <p>MFFL provides players and teams with both offensive and defensive ratings, using our elaborate rating system
        that varies between 50.0 and 100.0 for players and between 400 and 1500 for teams. For players, ratings are
        determined based on individual skill, where as
        for teams, we determine the rating by taking the adding of each players rating on said team.</p>
      <p>Never resting on our laurels, each year the MFFL looks to add more value to its members, whether it be
        additional English and French written content, league-wide general articles, the popular Game of the Week
        videos; we deliver the goods to keep our members engaged throughout the week, and not just on game day. </p>
      <p>The Montreal Flag Football League staff is made up of administrators, scorekeepers, media contributors and
        officials. In addition, MFFL's voluntary committees (Disciplinary, Rules) are made up of both officials and
        players in order to factor in the viewpoint and experiences of all parties involved in the league, and best
        incorporate them into our rules and protocols.</p>
      <p>At the end of the day, our mission is to help raise the bar of excellence in recreational sports leagues and
        we need <b>YOU</b> to help us do that, so drop what you are doing and <a href="register.html"><b>JOIN US
            NOW!</b></a></p>

        <h2>Another Week in the Books</h2>
        <p class="byline">Monday, July 11, 2022</p>
        <p>This past Saturday was a great day for football. It wasn't extremely hot, and it wasn't too windy. Sunday, on
          the other hand, was hot and humid with very little breeze in Montreal.</p>
        <p>Last weekend we were blessed with countless amazing games that came down to wire and kept fans on the edge of
          their seats! Weeks like these are why we are so excited for the future of this season cause if last week was
          any indication, we are in for one heck of a year!</p>

        <h2>The Most Wonderful Time of The Year</h2>
        <p class="byline">Monday, July 4, 2022</p>
        <p>Canada Day has come and gone and do you know what that means? A new season of the MFFL has begun! This year
          we promised big plays, amazing games and some unforgettable moments and my goodness, we got it all in just the
          first week!</p>
        <p>Every game was filled with non-stop action that left all of us wanting more. We saw new teams make their
          debuts, new players making statements and most importantly, players having the time of their lives.</p>
        <p>What a way to kick off a new season, this is truly the most wonderful time of the year!</p>
